# Thales Tendermint CodeSafe Library

This library complements the [Thales Tendermint HSM Validator](https://github.com/thales-e-security/tendermint-hsm-validator). It provides the code that runs within the Thales nShield HSM to perform the consensus signing.

This code is provided for example purposes only and requires an nShield HSM, with SEE feature activated, plus the CodeSafe Developer Kit. Please contact Thales (via https://www.thalesesecurity.com) before using this in production.

Please see the [Thales Tendermint HSM Validator](https://github.com/thales-e-security/tendermint-hsm-validator) for a longer description of the Tendermint validator concept.
